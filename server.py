# QUESTIONS
# - Correct way to get server IP? - GETFQDN
# - Can I kill client after check identity fail? - YES
# - Should we change dest_id to each target in broadcast? - NO
# - Server need seq_id? - NO

# TODO
# - Add docstrings
# - Change how to get server address in final version
# - Implement extra -> except KeyboardInterrupt
# - Compile all the functions in the same server_utils.py file
# - Make serv_id a global constant

# WORK PLAN
# - Add CTRL-C treatment to both clients
# - Add comments to code 
# - GG WP
